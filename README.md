## Research & Work Experience


Research Associate – Bioinformatics (Kaggle Projects & Competitions) 

Developed predictive models using machine learning & deep learning to analyse genomic datasets for disease classification. 

Applied high-throughput screening techniques and dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t- SNE, MKL) for biomarker identification. 

Built reproducible pipelines for multi-omics data integration using Python, R, and cloud-based tools. 

Machine Learning-Based Breast Cancer Diagnostic Tool (MSc Research, University of West London) 

Designed a multi-omics predictive model combining genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data for early breast cancer detection. 

Implemented feature selection techniques (LASSO, Recursive Feature Elimination, Differential Expression Analysis) for biomarker discovery. 
Built and validated models using Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting (ROC-AUC, sensitivity, specificity analysis). 

Developed an interactive diagnostic tool interface to improve clinical usability. 

 

Phylogenetic Analysis of CYP11A Gene in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (BSc Research, Osmania University) 

Conducted comparative phylogenetic analysis of CYP11A gene sequences in PCOS and non- PCOS populations. 

Used NCBI, Ensembl, MEGA, and ClustalW for sequence alignment and evolutionary tree construction. 

Investigated genetic variations linked to hormonal imbalances and metabolic pathways in PCOS.
